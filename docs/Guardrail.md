# 🛡️ Guardrail Design Principles

This document outlines the philosophy, structure, and contribution process for guardrails in the Human-Agent Collaboration Framework. Guardrails are modular constraints that ensure agents behave predictably, ethically, and transparently.

## 🎯 Purpose of Guardrails

Guardrails serve to:
- Prevent unsafe or non-compliant agent behavior
- Enforce readability and traceability in outputs
- Support modular and testable agent design

## 🧩 Guardrail Categories

| Type         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Behavioral   | Limits agent actions to defined roles or scopes                             |
| Structural   | Enforces naming conventions, modularity, and trace logging                  |
| Compliance   | Ensures outputs meet ethical, legal, or organizational standards            |

## 🛠️ How Guardrails Are Implemented

- **Modular Functions**: Each guardrail is a standalone function or class.
- **Config-Driven**: Guardrails can be toggled or customized via config files.
- **Testable**: Every guardrail must have at least one test case in `examples/`.

## 🧪 Example Guardrail: Role Restriction

```python
def enforce_role_scope(agent_role, user_request):
    if agent_role == "data_cleaner" and "delete" in user_request.lower():
        return "Request rejected: data_cleaner role cannot delete logs."
    return "Request accepted."

}
