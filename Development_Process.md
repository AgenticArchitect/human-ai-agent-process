# 🛠️ Development Process

This document outlines the step-by-step workflow for implementing the Human-Agent Software Development Process. It is designed for developers, QA engineers, and technical leads who collaborate with AI agents to build, refine, and validate software features.

## 🔄 Collaboration Cycle

1. **Human Prompting**
   - Define the task clearly using structured language.
   - Include context, constraints, and expected output format.

2. **Agent Response**
   - Agent generates pseudocode, implementation, or documentation.
   - Output includes embedded comments for traceability.

3. **Human Review**
   - Evaluate readability, correctness, and semantic hygiene.
   - Refine or reject agent output as needed.

4. **Test Case Execution**
   - Run predefined test cases to validate agent behavior.
   - Use edge cases and adversarial inputs to assess robustness.

5. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Repeat the cycle until the output meets quality standards.
   - Document decisions and rationale for future audits.

## 🧼 Semantic Hygiene Guidelines

- Variable names must be descriptive and context-aware.
- Comments should explain *why*, not just *what*.
- Avoid ambiguous terms, acronyms, or agent-specific jargon.
- Use the `agent_hygiene_guardrail.py` to enforce standards.

## 🧪 Test Case Design

| Test Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Baseline | Validate expected behavior under normal conditions |
| Edge Case | Test limits and boundary conditions |
| Adversarial | Challenge agent assumptions and logic |
| Regression | Ensure previous fixes remain intact |

---

## 🧰 Tools & Scripts

- `agent_hygiene_guardrail.py`: Enforces naming and comment standards.
- `config/agent_config.yaml`: Customize agent behavior and thresholds.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: Prompts contributors to confirm hygiene compliance.

---

## 📌 Notes

- All agent-generated code must be reviewed by a human before merging.
- Use the glossary (`GLOSSARY.md`) to maintain consistent terminology.
- Document each iteration to support traceability and compliance.

This process transforms AI from a black box into a transparent collaborator—one that learns, adapts, and improves alongside its human teammates.
