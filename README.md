# 🤝 Human-Agent Software Development Process

This repository showcases a structured framework for collaborative development between humans and AI agents. It emphasizes **readability**, **traceability**, and **semantic hygiene**, enabling teams to build AI-integrated systems that are robust, transparent, and adaptable.

## 🔍 Why This Matters

- ✅ Improves clarity and maintainability of AI-generated code
- 🔄 Enables iterative refinement between humans and agents
- 🧠 Bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders
- 🛡️ Introduces guardrails for agent behavior and naming conventions
