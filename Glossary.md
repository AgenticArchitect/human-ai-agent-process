# 📘 Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines key concepts, roles, and terminology used in the Human-Agent Software Development Process. It is intended to support clarity, consistency, and onboarding across technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### 🤖 Agent
An AI system that assists with software development tasks such as code generation, documentation, or test case creation. Operates within defined constraints and is subject to human review.

### 🧠 Human-Agent Collaboration
A structured workflow where humans and agents iteratively refine outputs. Emphasizes traceability, semantic hygiene, and shared accountability.

### 🧼 Semantic Hygiene
The practice of ensuring that variable names, comments, and code structure are readable, context-aware, and free from ambiguity. Enforced via `agent_hygiene_guardrail.py`.

### 🧪 Test Case
A predefined input-output scenario used to evaluate agent behavior. Includes baseline, edge case, adversarial, and regression types.

### 🔍 Traceability
The ability to follow the origin, rationale, and evolution of agent-generated outputs. Supports auditing, debugging, and compliance.

### 🛡️ Guardrail
A constraint or filter that limits agent behavior to ensure safety, clarity, and alignment with human expectations.

### 📄 Pseudocode
Structured, human-readable logic that outlines a solution without full implementation. Often used as an intermediate step in agent-human collaboration.

### 🧩 Iterative Refinement
The process of repeatedly improving agent outputs through human feedback, testing, and semantic adjustments.

### 🧰 `agent_hygiene_guardrail.py`
A script that enforces semantic hygiene by analyzing variable names and comments. Can be integrated into CI pipelines or used manually.

### ⚙️ `agent_config.yaml`
A configuration file that defines agent behavior, override tokens, and hygiene thresholds.
